Welcome to Enne's magical Aardwolf plugin garden.

### ü™∑ GoAFK

Type goafk &lt;your away message&gt;, and GoAFK will set your title to your AFK message, automatically reply to received tells with customizable messages, and prevent you from disconnecting due to inactivity.

Commands:

* goafkconfig

Shows configuration for the AFK system, letting you set:

* how long (in seconds) the auto-responder waits before responding to the same person again (default 60). If you're happy with the currently set value, just press enter, escape, or click Don't save.
* The title to be used when the AFK mode is removed with &ldquo;goafk off&rdquo;. If you're happy with the currently set value, just press enter, escape, or click the Don't save button.
* The list of messages that will be randomly picked from for auto-responding. If you're happy with the currently set list, just press escape, or click the Don't save button.

The messages are separated by a new line (inserted by pressing enter), and there are wildcards that can be used in the message. They are:
* %name%

Your character's name.

* %target%

The name of the player sending you a tell while you're AFK.

* %state%

The AFK message you've entered with the &ldquo;goafk &lt;away message&gt;&rdquo; command.

* %time%

The amount of time that has passed since you've turned on the AFK mode, e.g., 2 hours, 1 minute, and 2 seconds ago.

This can be combined into messages such as:

> Hey %target%, This is %name%'s AFK system. They have been %state% since %time%. They'll contact you once they're around again.

Which might result in an automatic reply such as:

> Hey Enne, this is Aily's AFK system. They have been sleeping since 22 minutes and 5 seconds ago. They'll contact you once they're around again.

* goafk

Shows help.

### üçÇ QuitCheck

Type &ldquo;qc put &lt;container&gt;&rdquo; to have the script put items that would be lost when disconnecting into a container, taking them out of containers or off of your keyring as it does. The items are remembered, so typing &ldquo;qc get &lt;container&gt;&rdquo; gets the same items from the container once you connect again, placing them into their original containers/on your keyring.
